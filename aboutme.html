      This is the about me tab. Here, we will be looking at some of my past experiences with coding, and, what inspired me to learn how to code!
        <br> For starters, I started getting involved in social media after I had uploaded my 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGUzkCYmD0Qi-5ebNm8wEMg"> own podcasts </a>
         just for fun. Making the podcasts meant learning how to edit videos and upload them properly.
        <br> 
        This became more and more interesting as I was experimenting with microphones and edit- tools. I later opened up a business that sold vitamins and supplements.
        The business was unfortunatley opened a month before COVID-19 caused shutdowns in RI. A month later, I made a connection and found someone to make my 
        <a href="https://vitastore.store"> website. </a> I figured it may be easier to learn for free (not really with college tuition but you get the point) than 
        to pay someone everytime I need a website fixed. Longterm, I want to be a cybersecurity lawyer.
