    This is the page were I will Insert my Javascript programs. In the meantime, I figured I would leave some links to helpful coding videos below: <br>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk"> Youtube Github Tutorial <a/>. <br>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg"> HTML full beginners course <a/>. <br>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuS1gmsF6rI"> Real life JR. developer video <a/>. <br>
  
  <br> 
  I wasn't sure how exactly the text criteria would be graded in regards to the amount or what exactly I had to be descriptive about. <br>
  I definetly see this page being one where people could use their skills for both fun and work. This would be a page in which I could look back on my work
  and use the work as inspiration in both the good and the bad perspectives. <br>
