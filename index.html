          <p>This page is about my ability to learn and then utilize my programming skills! Although I have some basic knowledge, it is next to none... but this is only a 
          positive, as I am eager to learn more and explore how else I might use coding for the future! Currently, things seem to be going smoothly with learning, even with COVID-19. </p>
