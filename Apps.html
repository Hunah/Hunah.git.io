        Currently, my favorite apps to use for coding or editing the final layout are <a href="https://getmimo.com"> Mimo </a> , 
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/"> Imovie </a> , 
            and 
        <a href="https://www.mematic.net"> Mematic. </a>
            <br>
            They work really well for the amature, and allow people to take on an artistic side to things, making them think more about the artform
            than the tedious work in between. This isn't to take away from the interesting art of coding, but it is to bring in another perspective.
